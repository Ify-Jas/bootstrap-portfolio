# bootstrap-portfolio
This is a different version of my portfolio webpage using bootstrap.

## Description


Link to deployed webpage: https://ify-jas.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/

This week's challenge was to create a portfolio webpage using Bootstrap and components in bootstrap such as card. This allowed me to make use of all I have learnt in week leading up to this challenge .

I structured my index.html page in such a way it can be easily understood and maintained. I followed the top to bottom reading mechanism. I tried as much as possible to make sure that each element tag is easy to locate and edit if need be. 

The CSS contains less work than I have done in the past and this is mainly down to Bootstrap and it's default CSS properties. I believe I was able to achieve most of the things I set out to achieve. 

I did find it difficult to separate the columns in the skills stack section without wrapping the third column to a new page.

1. I used the same top to bottom mechanism to create the CSS file to make it easy to track sections of the page. 
2. The CSS file contains comments to help the reader understand the parts of the page they are looking at.
3. I incorporated both a flex box and a grid.
4. I used my hyperlinks properly including the use of ID to link sections of the main page to the links on the navigation bar.
5. I used the :Hover to lay emphasis on my links


In general, this work was not as challenging as the previous portfolio but I also enjoyed it cause I learnt a lot trying to incorporate use Bootstrap and some of the utilities associated with it. I am happy with the final work and will surely be updating it in the future.
